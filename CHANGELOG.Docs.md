# Changelog for OpenXR-Docs and OpenXR-Registry Repos

Update log for the OpenXR-Docs and OpenXR-Registry repos on GitHub. Updates are
in reverse chronological order starting with the latest public release.

This summarizes the periodic public updates, not individual commits. Updates on
GitHub are generally done as single large patches at the release point,
collecting together the resolution of many Khronos internal issues, along with
any public pull requests that have been accepted.

This changelog only lists changes that affect the registry,
headers, and/or specification text.

## OpenXR Specification 1.0.7 (2020-03-20)

Patch release for the 1.0 series.

Updates version to 1.0.6.

Note: Changelogs are now being assembled with the help of the
[Proclamation](https://pypi.org/project/proclamation/) tool, so the format has
changed somewhat.

- Registry
  - Clarify the usage of `engineName` and `applicationName` in `XrApplicationInfo`.
    ([internal MR 1645](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1645))
  - Introduce `XR_MSFT_hand_interaction` extension for hand interaction profile.
    ([internal MR 1601](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1601))
  - Introduce `XR_EPIC_view_configuration_fov` extension for system field-of-view
    queries.
    ([internal MR 1170](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1170))
  - Indicate that `xrBeginFrame` returns `XR_ERROR_CALL_ORDER_INVALID` when not
    paired with a corresponding `xrWaitFrame` call.
    ([internal MR 1673](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1673))
  - Update the version number of `XR_KHR_D3D12_enable` extension.
  - ([internal MR 1681](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1681))
  - Introduce `XR_EXTX_overlay` extension for Overlay sessions (which can provide
    overlay composition layers).
    ([internal MR 1665](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1665))
- Specification
  - Clarify the usage of `engineName` and `applicationName` in `XrApplicationInfo`.
    ([internal MR 1645](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1645))
  - Simplify and update the specification build instructions in
    `specification/README.md`. On Windows, use of Windows Subsystem for Linux to
    build the spec is now assumed: Makefile code, etc. for retired methods (Cygwin,
    MinGW) remain for this release but are being considered for removal in an
    upcoming release to reduce maintenance burden. (They have not been tested in
    some time.) Note that this does not affect the build support of the SDK.
    ([internal MR 1692](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1692))
  - Introduce `XR_MSFT_hand_interaction` extension for hand interaction profile.
    ([internal MR 1601](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1601))
  - Adjust release scripts to publish the Style Guide and Extension Process with
    the rest of the specification.
    ([internal MR 1678](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1678))
  - Revise Style Guide and Extension Process, ratify by working group, and release.
    ([internal MR 1648](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1648))
  - Introduce `XR_EPIC_view_configuration_fov` extension for system field-of-view
    queries.
    ([internal MR 1170](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1170))
  - Clarify that every `xrWaitFrame` call must have a matching `xrBeginFrame`
    call and that there can be up to one outstanding call to `xrWaitFrame` for
    pipelined frame loops.
    ([internal MR 1673](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1673))
  - Specify expected D3D12 resource state of a depth swapchain image between
    `xrAcquireSwapchainImage` and `xrReleaseSwapchainImage`.
    ([internal MR 1681](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1681))
  - Update build scripts so that headers in the generated HTML have clickable
    anchor links that appear on hover, to provide a direct link to a heading.
    ([internal MR 1691](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1691))
  - Introduce `XR_EXTX_overlay` extension for Overlay sessions (which can provide
    overlay composition layers)
    ([internal MR 1665](https://gitlab.khronos.org/openxr/openxr/merge_requests/1665))

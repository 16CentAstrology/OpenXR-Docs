*Overview*

This extension allows the application to retrieve the recommended and
maximum field-of-view using flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews.
These field-of-view parameters can be used during initialization of the
application before creating a session.

The field-of-view given here should: not be used for rendering, see
flink:xrLocateViews to retrieve the field-of-view for rendering.

For views with `fovMutable` set to `XR_TRUE` the maximum field-of-view
should: specify the upper limit that runtime can support.
If the view has `fovMutable` set to `XR_FALSE` the runtime must: set
`maxMutableFov` to be the same as `recommendedFov`.

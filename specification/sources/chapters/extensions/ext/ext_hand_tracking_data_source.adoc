*Overview*

This extension augments the apiext:XR_EXT_hand_tracking extension.

Runtimes may: support a variety of data sources for hand joint data for
apiext:XR_EXT_hand_tracking, and some runtimes and devices may: use joint
data from multiple sources.
This extension allows an application and the runtime to communicate about
and make use of those data sources in a cooperative manner.

This extension allows the application to specify the data sources that it
wants data from when creating a hand tracking handle, and allows the runtime
to specify the currently active data source.

The application must: enable the apiext:XR_EXT_hand_tracking extension in
order to use this extension.

[open,refpage='XrHandTrackingDataSourceEXT',type='enums',desc='Describes the hand tracking data source.',xrefs='xrLocateHandJointsEXT xrCreateHandTrackerEXT']
--
The elink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceEXT enum describes a hand tracking data
source when creating an slink:XrHandTrackerEXT handle.

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrHandTrackingDataSourceEXT.adoc[]

The application can: use elink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceEXT with
slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT when calling
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT to tell the runtime all supported data sources
for the application for the hand tracking inputs.

The application can: use it with slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT when
calling flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT to inspect what data source the runtime
used for the returned hand joint locations.

If the apiext:XR_EXT_hand_joints_motion_range extension is supported by the
runtime and the data source is
ename:XR_HAND_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE_CONTROLLER_EXT, then it is expected that
application will use that extension when retrieving hand joint poses.

.Enumerant Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_HAND_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE_UNOBSTRUCTED_EXT - This data source
  value indicates that the hand tracking data source supports using
  individual fingers and joints separately.
  Examples of such sources include optical hand tracking, data gloves, or
  motion capture devices.
* ename:XR_HAND_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE_CONTROLLER_EXT - This data source value
  indicates that the hand tracking data source is a motion controller.
  The runtime must: not supply this data source if the controller providing
  the data is not actively held in the user's hand, but may: still provide
  data if the runtime is unable to detect if the controller is not in the
  user's hand, or a user selected policy changes this behavior.
  Unless specified otherwise by another extension, data returned from
  ename:XR_HAND_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE_CONTROLLER_EXT must: behave as
  ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_UNOBSTRUCTED_EXT.

The slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:requestedDataSourceCount is the number of elements in the
  pname:requestedDataSources array.
* pname:requestedDataSources is an array of
  elink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceEXT that the application accepts.
****

The slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT is a structure that an application
can: chain to slink:XrHandTrackerCreateInfoEXT::pname:next to specify the
hand tracking data sources that the application accepts.

Because the hand tracking device may: change during a running session, the
runtime may: return a valid slink:XrHandTrackerEXT handle even if there is
no currently active hand tracking device or the active device does not
safisty any or all data sources requested by the applications's call to
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT.
The runtime may: instead return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT, if for example the runtime believes it will
never be able to satisfy the request.

If any value in pname:requestedDataSources is duplicated, the runtime must:
return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE from the call to
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT.
If pname:requestedDataSourceCount is `0`, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE from the call to
flink:xrCreateHandTrackerEXT.

--
The slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:isActive indicating there is an active data source
* pname:dataSource indicating the data source that was used to generate the
  hand tracking joints.
****

slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT is a structure that an application
can: chain to slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT::pname:next when calling
flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT to retrieve the data source of the currently
active hand tracking device.

When the returned pname:isActive is `XR_FALSE`, it indicates the currently
active hand tracking device does not support any of the requested data
sources.
In these cases, the runtime must: also return no valid tracking locations
for hand joints from this flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT function.

If the tracker was not created with slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT
chained to slink:XrHandTrackerCreateInfoEXT::pname:next, then the runtime
must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE, if
slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT is passed in the call to
flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT.

If there is an active hand tracking device that is one of the specified
slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT::pname:requestedDataSources, the
runtime must: set pname:isActive to ename:XR_TRUE.
When the runtime sets pname:isActive to ename:XR_TRUE, the runtime must: set
pname:dataSource indicate the active data source.
The runtime must: return a pname:dataSource that is a subset of the
slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT::pname:requestedDataSources when
creating the corresponding hand tracker.

*Issues*

. Should this extension require
  ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_CONFORMING_TO_CONTROLLER_EXT if the data
  source is ename:XR_HAND_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE_CONTROLLER_EXT and
  apiext:XR_EXT_hand_joints_motion_range is not enabled?
+
*RESOLVED*: Yes.
+
It should not be required.
We expect that a key use of the data from this extension will be replicating
data hand tracking joint data for social purposes.
For that use-case, the data returned in the style of
ename:XR_HAND_JOINTS_MOTION_RANGE_UNOBSTRUCTED_EXT is more appropriate.
+
This is consistent with `XR_EXT_hand_tracking` extension which requires that
the `jointLocations` represent `the range of motion of a human hand, without
any obstructions`.

. Should slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT include an pname:isActive member or can it use pname:isActive from slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT?
+
*RESOLVED*: Yes.
+
Yes; slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceInfoEXT needs to include the
pname:isActive member and cannot use the pname:isActive from
slink:XrHandJointLocationsEXT as the meaning of these members is different.
+
The `isActive` member of slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT allows the
runtime to describe if the tracking device is active.
slink:XrHandTrackingDataSourceStateEXT::pname:isActive describes if the
tracking device is actively tracking.
It is possible for a data source to be active but not actively tracking and
we want to represent if the device is active in this extension.

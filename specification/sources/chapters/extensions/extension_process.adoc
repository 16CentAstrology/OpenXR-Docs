== Extension Processes

To help understand how OpenXR extensions are created and supported,
this section of the spec will discuss the various processes for
creating, supporting, and retiring extensions.

=== Extension Types

As mentioned in the <<extensions, Extensions>> section, OpenXR
extensions can take the form of:

* Khronos Extensions : Containing "KHR_" in their name
* Multi-vendor Extensions : Identified by the "EXT_" in their name
* Vendor-specific Extensions
  * Examples could include:
    * ARM - XR_ARM_...
    * Google - XR_GOOGLE_...
    * Oculus - Desktop: XR_OCULUS_...

[NOTE]
.Note
====
All vendor IDs are clearly identified in the OpenXR registry (xr.xml)
====


=== Typical Extension Process Flow

The typical extension process can be best described in the following way:

One company thinks of a new feature and creates their own vendor-specific
extension.
At some point, if they desire, the company reveals the extension to members
of the OpenXR Working Group (WG).

If multiple companies agree on the design, they can choose to create an
`EXT` extension that will be supported by multiple companies.
When creating the `EXT` extension, separate discussions must: occur outside
of the Khronos IP-Zone.

If a majority of companies within the working group desire to cooperate on
making the functionality more consistent across the OpenXR API, they can
discuss creating a new version of the extension as a Khronos extension with
the `KHR` prefix.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The originating company could still release their original vendor-specific
extension if they desire to get it out in a timely manner.
If everyone likes the direction, they can create a KHR extension.
====

Sometimes, multiple companies may come up with differing ideas of how to
implement a given feature.
Often, this will result in multiple vendor-specific extensions.
It is preferable to cooperate and create either `EXT` or `KHR` extensions
whenever possible since developers prefer to use common extensions.

It is also possible that the OpenXR working group could create a new
extension without any precedence.
When this occurs, the extension is released directly as a `KHR` extension.

A graphical view of the extension discussion flow can be seen in the
following picture:

==== Creating Extensions During Khronos Discussions

As shown in the above image, Khronos extensions belong in the Khronos IP zone
and all other extension types exist outside of the Khronos IP zone.
Khronos extensions, therefore, may be freely discussed and designed at any
time within Khronos.
However, because all other extensions are outside of the Khronos IP zone,
detailed design discussions within Khronos of these extensions should:
occur outside of Khronos email lists and/or meeting times.
If a non-KHR extension's design is discussed during any of these, the
discussion must: be clearly segregated and preceded by an indication that
the following discussion is on an extension that will not be part of Khronos IP.
It is preferable, to avoid talking about those types of extensions
within Khronos whenever possible.


=== Extension Registration Process

Each extension has a unique number used to identify it within the OpenXR API.
Since there can be multiple authors working on OpenXR extensions simultaneously,
the extension author must: first register the extension with the OpenXR
Working Group.
When registering an extension, the author only provides a minimal amount
of information about their extension to help avoid future spec conflicts.

The process is detailed in the OpenXR Styleguide under the "Registering
Extensions" section.
Please follow this process when creating extensions to avoid extension
merge collisions.

The rough process for registering an extension can be split into several
steps to accommodate extension number assignment prior to extension
publication:

1. Acquire an extension number.
 * This is done by proposing a merge request against xr.xml.
 * The merge should add a new <extension> tag at the end of the file with
   attributes specifying the proposed extension name, the next unused
   sequential extension number, the author and contact information
   (if different than that already specified for the author ID used in the
   extension name), and finally, disabling the extension using `supported="disabled"`
   instead of `supported="openxr"`.
 * The extension number will be reserved only once this merge request is
   accepted.
2. Develop and test the extension using the registered extension number.
3. Create a second merge request with the completed extension using the
   previously registered extension number, and submit it to the appropriate
   repository storing the OpenXR code.
 * This should include all necessary changes to the OpenXR specification,
   the OpenXR registry file (xr.xml) and any test or example source in the
   tree that is affected by the change.


=== Extension Approval Process

The extension approval process starts when a completed extension's
merge request has been properly submitted.
The approval process is important since no extension can be merged into
the OpenXR API Specification until it has been approved by the
appropriate members/companies.
The extension approval process does vary based upon what type of extension
is being submitted, and the differences are pointed out in the following
sections.


==== KHR Extension Approval Process

`KHR` extensions are a special case in the extension approval process because
they must be approved by a majority of the Working Group members.
A `KHR` extension must be developed in full view and with the participation of
the Khronos OpenXR Working Group (WG).
The development of the extension may: occur initially through the use of one or
more OpenXR mailing lists, but must: eventually be discussed during either a
Technical Sub-Group (TSG) conference call, the main Working Group conference
call, or at a Khronos Face-to-Face.
This required visibility is to provide sufficient time for members to provide
their own input as well as evaluate any potential Intellectual Property (IP)
concerns prior to an approval vote.

Typically, one member of the OpenXR WG, or one of the OpenXR TSGs, will
volunteer to `champion` the extension.
The `champion` is required to document the extension and all concerns as well
as create the final Merge Request to integrate the extension into the
appropriate branch.
Often, the appropriate branch will be the master branch, but this may vary.
This `champion` should work with all companies interested and address their
concerns about the extension when creating the final merge request.

After the appropriate members feel that the extension has progressed enough,
the `champion` must: submit the merge request to the Working Group for approval.
The merge request must: conform to the requirements identified in the sections above
regarding all extension related including the specification section formatting
and contents of the registry (xr.xml).

Once the Working group approves of the merge request and the extension, it must:
be submitted to the appropriate group within Khronos for final review and approval
before it can be made available to the public.

==== EXT Extension Approval Process

The process for accepting `EXT` extensions is different than that of accepting
`KHR` extensions.

Unlike the `KHR` extension approval process:

1. Only two or more companies need to be involved, and only one of them needs
   to be in the Working Group.
2. The IP is not considered to be Khronos IP, and so discussions during any
   Working Group or Technical Sub-Group time must: be preceded by the appropriate
   disclaimers.
3. Only the companies participating in the development of the `EXT` extension
   need to approve of it prior to creating a merge request.
 * This approval may be determined in whatever method the participating
   companies feel is appropriate.
4. The champion still must create the merge request against the appropriate branch.
 * In this case, only the participating companies are responsible for
   approving the merge request before review by the appropriate OpenXR
   Specification editor.
5. To indicate that the `EXT` extension has been approved by the appropriate
   members, the champion, or someone he designates, will submit the merge request
   to the Working Group for approval and indicate that it has been approved by
   all relevant members.
6. The Specification editor must: review the merge request and ensure that:
 * CI does not failed for any reason due to the changes within the merge request.
 * There are no pending conflicts.
 * The reviewer may: also perform a quick check of the correctness of the
   specification and registry (xr.xml) changes.
7. Once the editor is satisfied with their simple review, they (or someone
   approved by them to perform a merge) must: merge the merge request into the
   appropriate branch within a reasonable amount of time (typically within one
   or two weeks).


==== Vendor-Specific Extension Approval Process

Similar to an `EXT` extension, vendor-specific extensions should: not use OpenXR
WG or TSG time and may: be done entirely within the domain of the company
creating the extension.

For vendor-specific extensions, the main process is:

1. The company creating the extension identifies a `champion` to write up
   the extension merge request.
2. The company determines when they are ready to submit the merge request to the
   OpenXR Specification editor submitting an merge request with completed extension's
   changes.
3. The Specification editor must: review the merge request and ensure that:
 * CI does not failed for any reason due to the changes within the merge request.
 * There are no pending conflicts.
 * The reviewer may: also perform a quick check of the correctness of the
   specification and registry (xr.xml) changes.
4. Once the editor is satisfied with their simple review, they (or someone
  approved by them to perform a merge) must: merge the merge request into the
  appropriate branch within a reasonable amount of time (typically within one or
  two weeks).

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If an extension is not intended for private use on a company's particular
hardware, runtime or environment, it is recommended that they disclose
the extension to the WG.
This may occur during the step of merge request creation, but may occur
at any point the vendor desires.

This suggestion is based on the fact that other companies may be willing
to collaborate on the design of an `EXT` for common behavior.
`EXT` extensions are preferable for application developers since they are
guaranteed to work across more than one vendor.

However, sometimes a vendor may desire speed over collaboration and should:
not feel pressured into always using the `EXT` path for extensions.
====


=== Extension Deprecation Process

Extensions can be deprecated for several reasons:

1. The extension is no longer useful or supported
2. The extension has been replaced by another extension
3. The extension functionality has been merged into the core OpenXR API

In the case of either 1. or 2., what could happen is that Runtime vendors
will simply stop exporting support for a deprecated extension at some
point in the future.
This is okay since extensions are optional.
It is recommended that a transition period occur with some kind of
warning indicating that the extension is going away since applications
could be written that depend on it.

However, because released applications could depend on an extension, it is
preferable to support that extension at least until a new version of the
OpenXR API is released.
For example, if an extension is deprecated and it is written as part of
OpenXR 1.0, it is recommended that Runtimes remove support for that
extension no sooner than the release of OpenXR 1.1.

Deprecated extensions will continue to be listed in the OpenXR API, with
some indication that they have been deprecated, until at least the next
Major version bump of the OpenXR API.
This is also the case for extension features that have been merged into the
OpenXR core API (3. above).
In fact, it is recommended that on a major API version increase, that we
re-evaluate all available extensions and determine if they should be
removed from the API.

In comparison, Vulkan is currently thinking that no extensions will
survive the API bump from one major version to another (i.e 1.x to 2.x).
In this way, they can completely clean the slate of extensions.
OpenXR may, or may not want to do the same.

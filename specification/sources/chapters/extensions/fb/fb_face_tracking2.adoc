==== Overview

This extension enables applications to get weights of blend shapes.
It also enables applications to render facial expressions in XR experiences.

It is recommended to choose this extension over the
apiext:XR_FB_face_tracking extension, if it is supported by the runtime,
because this extension provides the following two additional capabilities to
the application:

* This extension provides additional seven blend shapes that estimate tongue
  movement.
* This extension allows an application and the runtime to communicate about
  the data sources that are used to estimate facial expression in a
  cooperative manner.

Face tracking data is sensitive personal information and is closely linked
to personal privacy and integrity.
Applications storing or transferring face tracking data should: always ask
the user for active and specific acceptance to do so.

If the runtime supports a permission system to control application access to
the face tracker, then the runtime must: set the pname:isValid field to
ename:XR_FALSE on the supplied slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB structure
until the user allows the application to access the face tracker.
When the application access has been allowed, the runtime should: set
pname:isValid on the supplied slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB structure to
ename:XR_TRUE.

Some permission systems may: control access to the eye tracking separately
from access to the face tracking, even though the eyes are part of the face.
In case the user denied tracking of the eyes, yet, allowed tracking of the
face, then the runtime must: set the pname:isEyeFollowingBlendshapesValid
field to ename:XR_FALSE on the supplied slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB for
indicating that eye tracking data is not available, but at the same time
may: set the pname:isValid field to ename:XR_TRUE on the supplied
slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB for indicating that another part of the
face is tracked properly.

****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:supportsVisualFaceTracking is an basetype:XrBool32, indicating if
  the current system is capable of receiving face tracking input that is
  estimated based on visual data source.
* pname:supportsAudioFaceTracking is an basetype:XrBool32, indicating if the
  current system is capable of receiving face tracking input that is
  estimated based on audio data source.
****

An application can: inspect whether the system is capable of receiving face
tracking input by extending the slink:XrSystemProperties with
slink:XrSystemFaceTrackingProperties2FB structure when calling
flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

If an application calls flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB only with unsupported
slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB::pname:requestedDataSources, the runtime
must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.
For example, if an application calls flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB only with
ename:XR_FACE_TRACKING_DATA_SOURCE2_AUDIO_FB in
slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB::pname:requestedDataSources when the
runtime returns ename:XR_FALSE for pname:supportsAudioFaceTracking, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.

The flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession in which the face tracker will be
  active.
* pname:createInfo is the slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB used to specify
  the face tracker.
* pname:faceTracker is the returned slink:XrFaceTracker2FB handle.
****

An application can: create an slink:XrFaceTracker2FB handle using
flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB function.

If the system does not support face tracking, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.
In this case, the runtime must: return ename:XR_FALSE for both
slink:XrSystemFaceTrackingProperties2FB::pname:supportsVisualFaceTracking
and slink:XrSystemFaceTrackingProperties2FB::pname:supportsAudioFaceTracking
when the function flink:xrGetSystemProperties is called, so that the
application can: avoid creating a face tracker.

The slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB structure is described as follows:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:faceExpressionSet is an elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB that describes
  the set of blend shapes to retrieve.
* pname:requestedDataSourceCount is the number of elements in the
  pname:requestedDataSources array.
* pname:requestedDataSources is an array of
  elink:XrFaceTrackingDataSource2FB that the application accepts.
  The order of values in the array has no significance.
****

The slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB structure describes the information to
create an slink:XrFaceTracker2FB handle.

Runtimes may: support a variety of data sources for estimations of facial
expression, and some runtimes and devices may: use data from multiple data
sources.
The application tells the runtime all data sources that the runtime may: use
to provide facial expressions for the application.

Because the device setting may: change during a running session, the runtime
may: return a valid slink:XrFaceTracker2FB handle even if the device is
unable to estimate facial expression using the data sources requested by the
application's call to flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.
The runtime must: instead return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB, if for example the runtime believes it will
never be able to satisfy the request.

If pname:requestedDataSourceCount is `0`, the runtime may: choose any
supported data source, preferably one that is more expressive than the
others.

If any value in pname:requestedDataSources is duplicated the runtime must:
return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE from the call to
flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB.

****

slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB structure returns the facial expression.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
pname:weightCount is not equal to the number of blend shapes defined by the
elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB used to create the slink:XrFaceTracker2FB.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
pname:confidenceCount is not equal to the number of confidence areas defined
by the elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB used to create the
slink:XrFaceTracker2FB.

The runtime must: return pname:weights representing the weights of blend
shapes of current facial expression.

The runtime must: update the pname:weights array ordered so that the
application can: index elements using the corresponding facial expression
enum (e.g. elink:XrFaceExpression2FB) as described by
elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB when creating the slink:XrFaceTracker2FB.
For example, when the slink:XrFaceTracker2FB is created with
ename:XR_FACE_EXPRESSION_SET2_DEFAULT_FB, the application sets the
pname:weightCount to ename:XR_FACE_EXPRESSION2_COUNT_FB, and the runtime
must: fill the pname:weights array ordered so that it can: be indexed by the
elink:XrFaceExpression2FB enum.

The runtime must: update the pname:confidences array ordered so that the
application can: index elements using the corresponding confidence area enum
(e.g. elink:XrFaceConfidence2FB) as described by
elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB when creating the slink:XrFaceTracker2FB.
For example, when the slink:XrFaceTracker2FB is created with
ename:XR_FACE_EXPRESSION_SET2_DEFAULT_FB, the application sets the
pname:confidenceCount to ename:XR_FACE_CONFIDENCE2_COUNT_FB, and the runtime
must: fill the pname:confidences array ordered so that it can: be indexed by
the elink:XrFaceConfidence2FB enum.

The runtime must: set pname:isValid to ename:XR_FALSE and it must: also set
all elements of pname:weights to zero, if one of the following is true:

* the face tracker failed to track or lost track of the face
* the application lost focus
* the consent for face tracking was denied
* the runtime is unable to estimate facial expression from the data sources
  specified when flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB function was called

If the returned pname:isValid is ename:XR_TRUE, the runtime must: return all
weights (or all weights except eyes related weights, see
pname:isEyeFollowingBlendshapesValid).

The runtime must: set pname:isEyeFollowingBlendshapesValid to ename:XR_FALSE
and it must: also set 8 expression weights with prefix
`XR_FACE_EXPRESSION2_EYES_LOOK_*` to zero, if one of the following is true:

* the eye tracking driving blendshapes with prefix
  `XR_FACE_EXPRESSION2_EYES_LOOK_*` lost track
* the consent for eye tracking was denied

==== Conventions of confidence areas

This extension defines two separate areas of confidence.

[open,refpage='XrFaceConfidence2FB',type='enums',desc='The name of face areas where confidence is known',xrefs='']
--
include::{generated}/api/enums/XrFaceConfidence2FB.txt[]

The "upper face" area represents everything above the upper lip, including
the eyes and eyebrows.
The "lower face" area represents everything under the eyes, including the
mouth and chin.
Cheek and nose areas contribute to both "upper face" and "lower face" areas.

*New Object Types*

* slink:XrFaceTracker2FB

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrObjectType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_OBJECT_TYPE_FACE_TRACKER2_FB

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_FACE_TRACKING_PROPERTIES2_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_FACE_TRACKER_CREATE_INFO2_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_FACE_EXPRESSION_INFO2_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_FACE_EXPRESSION_WEIGHTS2_FB

*New Enums*

* elink:XrFaceExpression2FB
* elink:XrFaceExpressionSet2FB
* elink:XrFaceConfidence2FB
* elink:XrFaceTrackingDataSource2FB

*New Structures*

* slink:XrSystemFaceTrackingProperties2FB
* slink:XrFaceTrackerCreateInfo2FB
* slink:XrFaceExpressionInfo2FB
* slink:XrFaceExpressionWeights2FB

*New Functions*

* flink:xrCreateFaceTracker2FB
* flink:xrDestroyFaceTracker2FB
* flink:xrGetFaceExpressionWeights2FB

*Issues*

* Should we add the tongue shapes to apiext:XR_FB_face_tracking as a new
  enum value in elink:XrFaceExpressionSetFB?
** **Resolved.** We expect that all applications should use
   apiext:XR_FB_face_tracking2 in the future and that
   apiext:XR_FB_face_tracking will ultimately be replaced by this extension.

*Version History*

*Overview*

The <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension provides a list of hand joint poses
which represent the current configuration of the tracked hands.
This extension adds a layer of gesture recognition that is used by the
system.

This extension allows:

* An application to get a set of basic gesture states for the hand when
  using the <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_HAND_TRACKING_AIM_STATE_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

slink:XrHandTrackingAimStateFB can: be provided in the pname:next chain of
slink:XrHandJointsLocateInfoEXT when calling flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT to
request aiming gesture information associated with this hand.

The slink:XrHandTrackingAimStateFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingAimStateFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:status is a bitmask of elink:XrHandTrackingAimFlagBitsFB describing
  the availability and state of other signals.
* pname:aimPose is a system-determined "aim" pose, similar in intent and
  convention to the <<aim-pose,aim poses>> used with the action system,
  based on hand data.
* pname:pinchStrengthIndex is the current pinching strength for the index
  finger of this hand.
  Range is 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning index and thumb are fully touching.
* pname:pinchStrengthMiddle is the current pinching strength for the middle
  finger of this hand.
  Range is 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning middle and thumb are fully touching.
* pname:pinchStrengthRing is the current pinching strength for the ring
  finger of this hand.
  Range is 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning ring and thumb are fully touching.
* pname:pinchStrengthLittle is the current pinching strength for the little
  finger of this hand.
  Range is 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning little and thumb are fully touching.

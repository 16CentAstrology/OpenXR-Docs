*Overview*

The <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension provides a list of hand joint poses
which include a collision sphere for each joint.
However some physics systems prefer to use capsules as a collision stand in
for the hands.

This extension allows:

* An application to get a list of capsules that represent the volume of the
  hand when using the <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

* ename:XR_FB_HAND_TRACKING_CAPSULE_POINT_COUNT
* ename:XR_FB_HAND_TRACKING_CAPSULE_COUNT

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_HAND_TRACKING_CAPSULES_STATE_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrHandCapsuleFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrHandCapsuleFB.txt[]

It describes a collision capsule associated with a hand joint.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:points are the two points defining the capsule length.
* pname:radius is the radius of the capsule.
* pname:joint is the hand joint that drives this capsule's transform.
  Multiple capsules can be attached to the same joint.

slink:XrHandTrackingCapsulesStateFB can: be provided in the pname:next chain
of slink:XrHandJointsLocateInfoEXT when calling flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT
to request collision capsule information associated with this hand.

The slink:XrHandTrackingCapsulesStateFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingCapsulesStateFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:capsules is an array of capsules.

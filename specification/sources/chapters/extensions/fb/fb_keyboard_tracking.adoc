*Overview*

This extension allows the application to query the system for a supported
trackable keyboard type and obtain an slink:XrSpace handle to track it.
It also provides relevant metadata about the keyboard itself, including
bounds and a human readable identifier.


*New Object Types*

*New Enum Constants*

* ename:XR_MAX_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_NAME_SIZE_FB

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_KEYBOARD_SPACE_CREATE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_QUERY_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_PROPERTIES_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrSystemKeyboardTrackingPropertiesFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemKeyboardTrackingPropertiesFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:supportsKeyboardTracking defines whether the system supports the
  tracked keyboard feature.
****

slink:XrSystemKeyboardTrackingPropertiesFB is populated with information
from the system about tracked keyboard support.

slink:XrKeyboardTrackingQueryFB specifies input data needed to determine
which type of tracked keyboard to query for.

* pname:flags additional information on the type of keyboard available.
  If ename:XR_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_EXISTS_BIT_FB is not set there is no
  keyboard.
* pname:name human readable keyboard identifier.
****

slink:XrKeyboardTrackingDescriptionFB describes a trackable keyboard and its
associated metadata.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:trackedKeyboardId abstract identifier describing the type of
  keyboard to track.
****

slink:XrKeyboardSpaceCreateInfoFB describes a request for the system needed
to create a trackable slink:XrSpace associated with the keyboard.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrQuerySystemTrackedKeyboardFB', desc='Queries the system keyboard',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrQuerySystemTrackedKeyboardFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrQuerySystemTrackedKeyboardFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the session that will be associated with a keyboard
  space.
* pname:queryInfo is the slink:XrKeyboardTrackingQueryFB that describes the
  type of keyboard to return.
  queryInfo must have either ename:XR_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_QUERY_LOCAL_BIT_FB
  or ename:XR_KEYBOARD_TRACKING_QUERY_REMOTE_BIT_FB set.
* pname:keyboard is the slink:XrKeyboardTrackingDescriptionFB output
  structure.
****

The flink:xrQuerySystemTrackedKeyboardFB function populates an
slink:XrKeyboardTrackingDescriptionFB structure with enough information to
describe a keyboard that the system can locate.

[open,refpage='xrCreateKeyboardSpaceFB',desc='Create a foveation profile',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrCreateKeyboardSpaceFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateKeyboardSpaceFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the session that will be associated with the returned
  keyboard space.
* pname:createInfo is the slink:XrKeyboardSpaceCreateInfoFB that describes
  the type of keyboard to track.
* pname:keyboardSpace is the slink:XrSpace output structure.
****

The flink:xrCreateKeyboardSpaceFB function returns an slink:XrSpace that can
be used to locate a physical keyboard in space.
The origin of the created slink:XrSpace is located in the center of the
bounding box in the x and z axes, and at the top of the y axis (meaning the
keyboard is located entirely in negative y).

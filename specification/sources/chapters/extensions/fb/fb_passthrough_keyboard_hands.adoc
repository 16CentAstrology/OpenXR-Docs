*Overview*

This extension enables applications to show passthrough hands when hands are
placed over the tracked keyboard.
It enables users to see their hands over the keyboard in a mixed reality
application.
This extension is dependent on <<XR_FB_passthrough>> extension which can be
used to create a passthrough layer for hand presence use-case.

The extension supports a single pair of hands (one left and one right hand),
multiple pair of hands are not supported.

This extension allows:

* Creation of keyboard hands passthrough layer using
  flink:xrCreatePassthroughLayerFB
* Setting the level of intensity for the hand mask in a passthrough layer
  with purpose elink:XrPassthroughLayerPurposeFB as
  ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_LAYER_PURPOSE_TRACKED_KEYBOARD_HANDS_FB or
  ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_LAYER_PURPOSE_TRACKED_KEYBOARD_MASKED_HANDS_FB


*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrPassthroughLayerPurposeFB enumeration is extended with a new
constant:

* ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_LAYER_PURPOSE_TRACKED_KEYBOARD_HANDS_FB - It defines
  a keyboard hands presence purpose of passthrough layer (i.e. basic mode,
  without hand transitions).
* ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_LAYER_PURPOSE_TRACKED_KEYBOARD_MASKED_HANDS_FB - It
  defines a keyboard hands presence purpose of passthrough layer with
  keyboard masked hand transitions.
  A hand mask will be visible only when hands are inside the region of VR
  keyboard (i.e. hands over the keyboard).

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH_KEYBOARD_HANDS_INTENSITY_FB

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB',type='structs',desc='A struct for setting the level of intensity for hands in the passthrough layer',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:leftHandIntensity defines an intensity for the left tracked hand.
* pname:rightHandIntensity defines an intensity for the right tracked hand.
****

slink:XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB describes intensities of
passthrough hands, and is used as a parameter to
flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetKeyboardHandsIntensityFB.

Each of the intensity values pname:leftHandIntensity and
pname:rightHandIntensity must: be in the range [0.0, 1.0].
The hand intensity value represents the level of visibility of rendered
hand, the minimal value of the intensity 0.0 represents the fully
transparent hand (not visible), the maximal value of 1.0 represented fully
opaque hands (maximal visibility).

If either pname:leftHandIntensity or pname:rightHandIntensity is outside the
range [0.0, 1.0], the runtime must return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetKeyboardHandsIntensityFB function is defined
as:

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:layer is the slink:XrPassthroughLayerFB to apply the intensity.
* pname:intensity is the slink:XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB to be
  set.

Sets an slink:XrPassthroughKeyboardHandsIntensityFB intensity on an
slink:XrPassthroughLayerFB layer.

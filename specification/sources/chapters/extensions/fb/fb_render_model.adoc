*Overview*

This extension allows applications to request GLTF models for certain
connected devices supported by the runtime.
Paths that correspond to these devices will be provided through the
extension and can be used to get information about the models as well as
loading them.

*New Flag Types*

[open,refpage='XrRenderModelFlagsFB',type='flags',desc='XrRenderModelFlagsFB']
--
include::{INCS-VAR}/api/flags/XrRenderModelFlagsFB.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='XrRenderModelFlagBitsFB',type='enums',desc='XrRenderModelFlagBitsFB',xrefs='XrRenderModelFlagsFB']
--
include::{INCS-VAR}/api/enums/XrRenderModelFlagBitsFB.txt[]

There are currently no render model flags.
This is reserved for future use.
--

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_RENDER_MODEL_PROPERTIES_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_PATH_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_PROPERTIES_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_BUFFER_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_RENDER_MODEL_LOAD_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_MAX_RENDER_MODEL_NAME_SIZE_FB

*New Defines*

[open,refpage='XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB',type='defines',desc='The value representing an invalid model key',xrefs='XrRenderModelKeyFB XrRenderModelPropertiesFB']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/defines/XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB.txt[]

dlink:XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB defines an invalid model key atom.
--

*New Base Types*

[open,refpage='XrRenderModelKeyFB',desc='Model key',type='basetypes',xrefs='XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/basetypes/XrRenderModelKeyFB.txt[]

The unique model key used to retrieve the data for the render model that is
valid across multiple instances and installs.
The application can use this key along with the model version to update its
cached or saved version of the model.
--

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB',type='structs',desc='A render model system property',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrSystemRenderModelPropertiesFB.txt[]

It describes a render model system property.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:supportsRenderModelLoading defines whether the system supports
  loading render models.

slink:XrRenderModelPathInfoFB contains a model path supported by the device
when returned from flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.

connected device that the path represents using
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.

.Possible Render Model Paths
****
* Controller models with origin at the grip pose.
** pathname:/model_fb/controller/left
** pathname:/model_fb/controller/right
* Keyboard models with origin at the center of its bounding box.
** pathname:/model_fb/keyboard/local
** pathname:/model_fb/keyboard/remote

slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB contains information about the render model
for a device.
slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB must: be provided when calling
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.
The basetype:XrRenderModelKeyFB included in the properties is a unique key
for each render model that is valid across multiple instances and installs.

If the application decides to cache or save the render model in any way,
pname:modelVersion can be used to determine if the render model has changed.
The application should: then update its cached or saved version.

  or the required capacity in the case that pname:bufferCapacityInput is
  `0`.

  filled with the render model binary data.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a

slink:XrRenderModelBufferFB is used when loading the binary data for a
render model.
slink:XrRenderModelBufferFB must: be provided when calling

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB',desc='Enumerate supported render model paths',type='protos',xrefs='']

The flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the specified slink:XrSession.
* pname:pathCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:paths, or 0 to
  retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:pathCountOutput is a pointer to the count of code:float pname:paths
  written, or a pointer to the required capacity in the case that
  pname:pathCapacityInput is `0`.
* pname:paths is a pointer to an application-allocated array that will be
  filled with slink:XrRenderModelPathInfoFB values that are supported by the
  runtime, but can: be code:NULL if pname:pathCapacityInput is `0`
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:paths size.
****

The application must: call flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB to enumerate
the valid render model paths that are supported by the runtime before
calling flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.
The paths returned may: be used later in flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.txt[]

[open,refpage='xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB',desc='Get information for a render model',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the specified slink:XrSession.
* pname:path is the path of the render model to get the properties for.
* pname:properties is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelPropertiesFB to
  write the render model information to.
****

flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB is used for getting information for a
render model using a path retrieved from
flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.
The information returned will be for the connected device that corresponds
to the path given.
For example, using pathname:/model_fb/controller/left will return
information for the left controller that is currently connected and will
change if a different device that also represents a left controller is
connected.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_CALL_ORDER_INVALID if
flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB is called with render model paths before
calling flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_PATH_INVALID if a path not given by
flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelPathsFB is used.

If flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB returns a success code of
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE_FB and has a pname:modelKey of
dlink:XR_NULL_RENDER_MODEL_KEY_FB, this indicates that the model for the
device is unavailable.
The application may: keep calling flink:xrGetRenderModelPropertiesFB because
the model may: become available later when a device is connected.

--
The flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrLoadRenderModelFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the specified slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelLoadInfoFB structure.
* pname:buffer is a pointer to the slink:XrRenderModelBufferFB structure to
  write the binary data into.
****

flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB is used to load the GLTF model data using a valid
pname:modelKey.
flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB loads the model as a byte buffer containing the
GLTF in the binary format (GLB).
The GLB data must: conform to the glTF 2.0 format defined at
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0.
The GLB may: contain texture data in a format that requires the use of the
`KHR_texture_basisu` GLTF extension defined at
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu.
Therefore, the application should: ensure it can handle this extension.

If the device for the requested model is disconnected or does not match the
pname:modelKey provided, flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB must: return
ename:XR_RENDER_MODEL_UNAVAILABLE_FB as well as a pname:bufferCountOutput
value of 0 indicating that the model was not available.

The flink:xrLoadRenderModelFB function may: be slow, therefore applications
should: call it from a non-time sensitive thread.

*Overview*

This extension expands on the concept of spatial entities to include a way
for a spatial entity to represent rooms, objects, or other boundaries in a
scene.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

The slink:XrExtent3DfFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrExtent3DfFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:width is the floating-point width of the extent.
* pname:height is the floating-point height of the extent.

****

This structure is used for component values that may be fractional
(floating-point).
If used to represent physical distances, values must be in meters.
The width, height, and depth values must be non-negative.

The bounding box is defined by an pname:offset and pname:extent.
The pname:offset refers to the coordinate of the minimum corner of the box
in the local space of the slink:XrSpace; that is, the corner whose
coordinate has the minimum value on each axis.
The pname:extent refers to the dimensions of the box along each axis.
The maximum corner can therefore be computed as [eq]#pname:offset +
pname:extent#.

.Member Descriptions
****

****

The slink:XrSemanticLabelsSupportInfoFB structure may: be specified in the
pname:next chain of slink:XrSemanticLabelsFB to specify additional behaviors
of the flink:xrGetSpaceSemanticLabelsFB function.
The runtime must: follow the behaviors specified in pname:flags according to
the descriptions of elink:XrSemanticLabelsSupportFlagBitsFB.
The runtime must: return any semantic label that is not included in
pname:recognizedLabels as "OTHER" to the application.
The runtime must: follow this direction only if the runtime reports the
pname:extensionVersion as 2 or greater, otherwise the runtime must: ignore
this as an unknown chained structure.

If the slink:XrSemanticLabelsSupportInfoFB structure is not present in the
pname:next chain of slink:XrSemanticLabelsFB, the runtime may: return any
semantic labels to the application.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrGetSpaceBoundingBox2DFB',desc='Gets the 2D bounding box for a spatial entity',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrGetSpaceBoundingBox2DFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetSpaceBoundingBox2DFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace handle to the spatial entity.
* pname:boundingBox2DOutput is an output parameter pointing to the structure
  containing the 2D bounding box for pname:space.
****

Gets the 2D bounding box for a spatial entity with the
ename:XR_SPACE_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_2D_FB component type enabled.

The bounding box is defined by an pname:offset and pname:extent.
The pname:offset refers to the coordinate of the minimum corner of the box
in the x-y plane of the given slink:XrSpace's coordinate system; that is,
the corner whose coordinate has the minimum value on each axis.
The pname:extent refers to the dimensions of the box along each axis.
The maximum corner can therefore be computed as [eq]#pname:offset +
pname:extent#.

*Overview*

This extension expands on the concept of spatial entities to include a way
for a spatial entity to represent rooms, objects, or other boundaries in a
scene.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SEMANTIC_LABELS_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_ROOM_LAYOUT_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_BOUNDARY_2D_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

This structure is used for component values that may be fractional
(floating-point).
If used to represent physical distances, values must be in meters.

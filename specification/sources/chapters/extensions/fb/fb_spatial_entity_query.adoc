*Overview*

This extension enables an application to discover persistent spatial
entities in the area and restore them.
Using the query system, the application can: load persistent spatial
entities from storage.
The query system consists of a set of filters to define the spatial entity
search query and an operation that needs to be performed on the search
results.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

The slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoBaseHeaderFB is a base structure that is not
intended to be directly used, but forms a basis for specific query info
types.
All query info structures begin with the elements described in the
slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoBaseHeaderFB, and a query info pointer must: be cast
to a pointer to slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoBaseHeaderFB when passing it to the
flink:xrQuerySpacesFB function.

The slink:XrSpaceFilterInfoBaseHeaderFB is a base structure that is not
intended to be directly used, but forms a basis for specific filter info
types.
All filter info structures begin with the elements described in the
slink:XrSpaceFilterInfoBaseHeaderFB, and a filter info pointer must: be cast
to a pointer to slink:XrSpaceFilterInfoBaseHeaderFB when populating
slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoFB::pname:filter and
slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoFB::pname:excludeFilter to pass to the
flink:xrQuerySpacesFB function.

****

May be used to query for spaces and perform a specific action on the spaces
returned.
The available actions are enumerated in elink:XrSpaceQueryActionFB.
The filter info provided to the pname:filter member of the struct is used as
an inclusive filter.
The filter info provided to the pname:excludeFilter member of the structure
is used to exclude spaces from the results returned from the filter.
All spaces that match the criteria in pname:filter, and that do not match
the criteria in pname:excludeFilter, must: be included in the results
returned.
This is to allow for a more selective style query.

*New Functions*

The flink:xrQuerySpacesFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrQuerySpacesFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info is a pointer to the slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoBaseHeaderFB
  structure.
* pname:requestId is an output parameter, and the variable it points to will
  be populated with the ID of this asynchronous request.
****

The flink:xrQuerySpacesFB function enables an application to find and
retrieve spatial entities from storage.
Cast an slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoFB pointer to a
slink:XrSpaceQueryInfoBaseHeaderFB pointer to pass as pname:info.
The application should: keep the returned pname:requestId for the duration
of the request as it is used to refer to the request when calling
flink:xrRetrieveSpaceQueryResultsFB and is used to map completion events to
the request.
This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceQueryCompleteFB event when the operation completes
successfully or encounters an error.
The runtime must: post an slink:XrEventDataSpaceQueryResultsAvailableFB if
before slink:XrEventDataSpaceQueryCompleteFB if any results are found.
Once an slink:XrEventDataSpaceQueryResultsAvailableFB event has been posted,
the application may: call flink:xrRetrieveSpaceQueryResultsFB to retrieve
the available results.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession for which the in-progress query is
  valid.
* pname:requestId is the basetype:XrAsyncRequestIdFB to enumerate results
  for.
* pname:results is a pointer to an slink:XrSpaceQueryResultsFB to populate
  with results.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required size of the results in
  this parameter.
****

Allows an application to retrieve all available results for a specified
query.
Call this function once to get the number of results found and then once
more to copy the results into a buffer provided by the application.
The number of results will not change between the two calls used to retrieve
results.
This function must: only retrieve each query result once.
After the application has used this function to retrieve a query result, the
runtime frees its copy.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
pname:requestId refers to a request that is not yet complete, a request for
which results have already been retrieved, or if pname:requestId does not
refer to a known request.

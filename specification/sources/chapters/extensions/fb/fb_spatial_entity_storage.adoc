*Overview*

This extension enables spatial entities to be stored and persisted across
sessions.
If the ename:XR_SPACE_COMPONENT_TYPE_STORABLE_FB component has been enabled
on the spatial entity, application developers may: save, load, and erase
persisted slink:XrSpace entities.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<fundamentals-extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_SAVE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_SPACE_ERASE_INFO_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPACE_SAVE_COMPLETE_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_SPACE_ERASE_COMPLETE_FB

The elink:XrSpaceStorageLocationFB enumeration contains the storage
locations used to store, erase, and query spatial entities.

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrSpaceSaveInfoFB',type='structs',desc='Parameters for a save operation',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSpaceSaveInfoFB.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace handle to the space of the entity to be
  saved.
* pname:location is the storage location.
* pname:persistenceMode is the persistence mode.
****

The slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB structure contains information used to save the
spatial entity.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrSpaceSaveInfoFB.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='XrSpaceEraseInfoFB',type='structs',desc='Parameters for an erase operation',xrefs='']
--
The slink:XrSpaceEraseInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSpaceEraseInfoFB.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:space is the slink:XrSpace handle to the reference space that
  defines the entity to be erased.
* pname:location is the storage location.
****

The slink:XrSpaceEraseInfoFB structure contains information used to erase
the spatial entity.

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrSpaceEraseInfoFB.adoc[]
--

[open,refpage='XrEventDataSpaceSaveCompleteFB',type='structs',desc='Describes the result of a save operation',xrefs='xrPollEvent XrEventDataBuffer XrEventDataBaseHeader']
--
The slink:XrEventDataSpaceSaveCompleteFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataSpaceSaveCompleteFB.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestId is the ID of the asynchronous request to save an entity.
* pname:result is an elink:XrResult that describes whether the request
  succeeded or if an error occurred.
* pname:space is the spatial entity being saved.
* pname:uuid is the UUID for the spatial entity being saved.
* pname:location is the location of the spatial entity being saved.
****

The save result event contains the success of the save/write operation to
the specified location, as well as the slink:XrSpace handle on which the
save operation was attempted on, the unique UUID, and the triggered async
request ID from the initial calling function.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:requestId is the ID of the asynchronous request to erase an entity.
* pname:result is an elink:XrResult that describes whether the request
  succeeded or if an error occurred.
* pname:space is the spatial entity being erased.
* pname:uuid is the UUID for the spatial entity being erased.
* pname:location is the location of the spatial entity being erased.
****

The erase result event contains the success of the erase operation from the
specified storage location.
It also provides the UUID of the entity and the async request ID from the
initial calling function.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrSaveSpaceFB',desc='Saves a spatial entity to persistent storage',type='protos',xrefs='xrEraseSpaceFB']
--
The flink:xrSaveSpaceFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrSaveSpaceFB.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info contains the parameters for the save operation.
* pname:requestId is an output parameter, and the variable it points to will
  be populated with the ID of this asynchronous request.
****

The flink:xrSaveSpaceFB function persists the spatial entity at the
specified location with the specified mode.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB::pname:space is dlink:XR_NULL_HANDLE or otherwise
invalid.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB::pname:location or
slink:XrSpaceSaveInfoFB::pname:persistenceMode is invalid.
This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceSaveCompleteFB event when the operation completes
successfully or encounters an error.
If this function returns a failure code, no event is posted.

[open,refpage='xrEraseSpaceFB',desc='Erases a spatial entity from persistent storage',type='protos',xrefs='xrSaveSpaceFB']
--
The flink:xrEraseSpaceFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEraseSpaceFB.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a handle to an slink:XrSession.
* pname:info contains the parameters for the erase operation.
* pname:requestId is an output parameter, and the variable it points to will
  be populated with the ID of this asynchronous request.
****

The flink:xrEraseSpaceFB function erases a spatial entity from storage at
the specified location.
The slink:XrSpace remains valid in the current session until the application
destroys it or the session ends.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
slink:XrSpaceEraseInfoFB::pname:space is dlink:XR_NULL_HANDLE or otherwise
invalid.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
slink:XrSpaceEraseInfoFB::pname:location is invalid.
This operation is asynchronous and the runtime must: post an
slink:XrEventDataSpaceEraseCompleteFB event when the operation completes
successfully or encounters an error.
If this function returns a failure code, no event is posted.

==== Overview

This extension allows an application to locate the user's individual body
joints.
It enables applications to render the full body in XR experience.


==== Inspect system capability

[open,refpage='XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC',type='structs',desc='System property for body tracking',xrefs='XrSystemProperties xrGetSystemProperties']
--

The slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:supportsBodyTracking indicates if the current system is capable of
  track individual body joints.
****

An application can: inspect whether the system is capable of body tracking
by extending the slink:XrSystemProperties with
slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC structure when calling
flink:xrGetSystemProperties.

If a runtime returns ename:XR_FALSE for pname:supportsBodyTracking, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from
flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerHTC.

==== Create a body tracker handle

[open,refpage='XrBodyTrackerHTC',type='handles',desc='Represents a tracker for locating body joints.']
--
The slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC handle represents the resources for a body
tracker.

include::{generated}/api/handles/XrBodyTrackerHTC.adoc[]

An application can: create an slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC handle which is used to
locate individual body joints with an unobstructed range of motion using
flink:xrLocateBodyJointsHTC function.

  specify the set of body joints.
* pname:bodyTracker is the returned slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC handle.
****

An application can: create an slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC handle using
flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerHTC.

If the system does not support body tracking, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED from flink:xrCreateBodyTrackerHTC.
In this case, the runtime must: return ename:XR_FALSE for
slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC::pname:supportsBodyTracking in
slink:XrSystemBodyTrackingPropertiesHTC when the function
flink:xrGetSystemProperties is called, so that the application avoids
creating a body tracker.

****

The application must: set pname:jointLocationCount as appropriate for the
chosen elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC value when creating the
slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC.
If pname:jointLocationCount does not match the value associated with the
supplied elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC value, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE from flink:xrLocateBodyJointsHTC.

An application must: allocate the output pname:jointLocations array with a
minimum capacity of pname:jointLocationCount of slink:XrBodyJointLocationHTC
elements.
If the application supplies a code:NULL value for pname:jointLocations, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The runtime must: update the pname:jointLocations array elements indexed
using the corresponding body joint enumeration (e.g. elink:XrBodyJointHTC
for the joint set ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC) as described by
elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC when creating the slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC.
For example, when the slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC is created with
ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC, the runtime must: fill the
pname:jointLocations array with body joint data indexed by the
elink:XrBodyJointHTC enumeration.

If the runtime returns pname:combinedLocationFlags with
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT and
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_VALID_BIT set, it indicates that the
body tracker detects the joint space locations.
If the runtime returns pname:combinedLocationFlags with neither
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT nor
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_ORIENTATION_VALID_BIT set, it indicates that the
body tracker did not detect the joint space locations.

The purpose of the skeleton is to provide data about the body size.
The calculation of the body size may: be updated during a session.
Each time the calculation of the size is changed,
slink:XrBodyJointLocationsHTC::pname:skeletonGenerationId is changed to
indicate that a new skeleton may: be retrieved.
flink:xrGetBodySkeletonHTC can: be called with the specified
skeletonGenerationId to get the corresponding skeleton.

  skeleton in T-pose will be represented.
* pname:skeletonGenerationId is the skeleton id of the skeleton.
* pname:skeleton is a pointer to slink:XrBodySkeletonHTC receiving the
  returned body skeleton.
****

The flink:xrGetBodySkeletonHTC function returns the body skeleton in T-pose.
This function can: be used to get body skeleton and infer the skeleton scale
and proportions in conjunction with
slink:XrBodyJointLocationsHTC::pname:skeletonGenerationId.
slink:XrBodyJointLocationsHTC::pname:skeletonGenerationId is generated when
the tracking auto-calibrates the user skeleton scale and proportions.

If the application supplies a pname:skeletonGenerationId that does not match
any value returned in
slink:XrBodyJointLocationsHTC::pname:skeletonGenerationId during the current
session, the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

  pname:joints array.
* pname:joints is an application-allocated array of
  slink:XrBodySkeletonJointHTC that will be filled with skeleton joint
  elements.
****

The slink:XrBodySkeletonHTC structure is a container to represent the body
skeleton in T-pose including each joint pose.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if
pname:jointCount does not equal the number of joints associated with the
elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC value used to create the slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC.

The application must: allocate an array of at least pname:jointCount
elements for pname:joints, to be populated by the runtime.
If pname:joints is code:NULL, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The runtime must: return pname:joints representing the default pose of the
current estimation regarding the user's skeleton.

The runtime must: update the pname:joints array ordered so that it is
indexed using the corresponding body joint enumeration (e.g.
elink:XrBodyJointHTC for the joint set ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC) as
associated with the elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC value used when creating the
slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC.
For example, when the slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC is created with
ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC, the runtime must: fill the pname:joints
array indexed by the elink:XrBodyJointHTC enumeration.

--
The elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC enumeration is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrBodyJointSetHTC.adoc[]

.Enumerant Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC indicates that the created
  slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC tracks the set of body joints described by
  elink:XrBodyJointHTC enum, i.e. the flink:xrLocateBodyJointsHTC function
  returns an array of joint locations with the count of
  dlink:XR_BODY_JOINT_COUNT_HTC and is indexed using elink:XrBodyJointHTC.
****

The elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC enumeration describes the set of body joints to
track when creating an slink:XrBodyTrackerHTC.

[open,refpage='XrBodyJointHTC',type='enums',desc='Indices for body joint names',xrefs='XR_BODY_JOINT_COUNT_HTC XrBodyJointSetHTC']
--
The elink:XrBodyJointHTC enumeration is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrBodyJointHTC.adoc[]

It is used to index into a joint location array when the joint set in use
(elink:XrBodyJointSetHTC) is ename:XR_BODY_JOINT_SET_FULL_HTC.

This extension defines 26 joints for body tracking: 6 joints for the torso,
5 joints for each arm, 4 joints for each leg, and the other 2 joints for the
head and neck.
The definitions of these joints are based on human skeletal joints.

As shown in the figure below, the following conventions are stated with a
T-shape body pose in which the palms are facing down to the ground.

The right direction (+X) is pointing from left hand to right hand in T-pose.

The up direction (+Y) is pointing from foot to head in T-pose.

The Z direction is perpendicular to X and Y and follows the right hand rule
in T-pose.

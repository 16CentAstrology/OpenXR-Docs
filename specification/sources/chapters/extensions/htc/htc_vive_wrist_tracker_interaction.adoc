*Overview*

This extension provides an basetype:XrPath for getting device input from a
VIVE wrist tracker to enable its interactions.
VIVE wrist tracker is a tracked device mainly worn on user's wrist for pose
tracking.
Besides this use case, user also can tie it to a physical object to track
its object pose, e.g. tie on a gun.

*VIVE Wrist Tracker input*

This extension exposes a new interaction profile path
pathname:/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_wrist_tracker that is valid for the
user path

* pathname:/user/wrist_htc/left
* pathname:/user/wrist_htc/right

with supported input subpaths

* On pathname:/user/wrist_htc/left only:
** subpathname:/input/menu/click
** subpathname:/input/x/click
* On pathname:/user/wrist_htc/right only:
** subpathname:/input/system/click (may: not be available for application
   use)
** subpathname:/input/a/click
* subpathname:/input/entity_htc/pose

// This extension does not meet the current style guide requirements:
// the path name must be vendor-suffixed in new extensions.
:legacy-path: /interaction_profiles/htc/vive_wrist_tracker

The entity_htc pose allows the applications to recognize the origin of a
tracked input device, especially for the wearable devices which are not held
in the user's hand.
The entity_htc pose is defined as follows:

* The entity position: The center position of the tracked device.
* The entity orientation: Oriented with +Y up, +X to the right, and -Z
  forward.

*Overview*

ColorScale and ColorOffset are auxiliary tinting factors applied to a given layer texture during composition. 
It is useful for when the provided layer texture is static, but the application wants to do layer fading. 
ColorScale and ColorOffset allow this to happen without having to update the layer texture. 
Color scale must: be applied if the color scale is anything but [eq]#(1,1,1,1)# and regardless of the
ename:XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_BLEND_TEXTURE_SOURCE_ALPHA_BIT enabling flag.
Color offset must: be applied if the color offset is anything but [eq]#(0,0,0,0)# and regardless of the
ename:XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_BLEND_TEXTURE_SOURCE_ALPHA_BIT enabling flag.

ColorScale and ColorOffset must: be interpreted as being non-premultiplied-alpha color components. 
ColorScale input values must: be clamped by the runtime to be no lower than #[eq](0.0), but have no upper bound.
ColorOffset values are must: not be clamped. 

The color scale RGB color values must: be multiplied with the layer texture RGB values to specify a displayed RGB value. 
The color scale alpha specifies an opacity multiplier to be applied against the opacity of the layer texture. 
Color offset values must: be applied after color scale values are applied as described above. 
The texture is assumed to have premultiplied alpha, which must: be removed before the color scale and offset are applied, then restored.

The resulting color used to composite the texture must: be calculated as follows:

- Color.A = (Texture.A * ColorScale.A) + ColorOffset.A
- Color.R = (((Texture.R / Texture.A) * ColorScale.R) + ColorOffset.R) * Color.A
- Color.G = (((Texture.G / Texture.A) * ColorScale.G) + ColorOffset.G) * Color.A
- Color.B = (((Texture.B / Texture.A) * ColorScale.B) + ColorOffset.B) * Color.A

If the resulting color alpha is greater than one, all components of the resulting color must: be divided by the resulting color alpha.
If Texture.A is zero, then ColorScale must: have no effect, as follows:

- Color.A = ColorOffset.A
- Color.R = ColorOffset.R * ColorOffset.A
- Color.G = ColorOffset.G * ColorOffset.A
- Color.B = ColorOffset.B * ColorOffset.A

This extension specifies the slink:XrCompositionLayerColorModulationInfoKHR struct, which, if present in the slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader::pname:next list, must: be applied to arbitrary submitted composition layers.

The slink:XrCompositionLayerColorModulationInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerColorModulationInfoKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:colorScale is an slink:XrColor4f which will modulate the color sourced from the images.
* pname:colorOffset is an slink:XrColor4f which will offset the color sourced from the images.
****

slink:XrCompositionLayerColorModulationInfoKHR contains the information needed to define auxiliary tinting factors for layer textures.

The slink:XrCompositionLayerColorModulationInfoKHR struct can: be applied 
by applications to arbitrary submitted composition layers. Application is done by adding an instance
of the struct to the slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader::pname:next list. At most only a single such struct
may: be added to a given layer; it is invalid to add more than one.

Even if the layer's texture alpha channel is disabled due to ename:XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_BLEND_TEXTURE_SOURCE_ALPHA_BIT being unused, layer alpha blending occurs if there's a non-unity color scale or color offset alpha.

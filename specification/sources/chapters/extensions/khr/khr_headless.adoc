*Overview*

This extension enables headless operation, i.e., without interacting with
any display devices or initializing the OpenXR compositor.
It is intended to facilitate novel uses of OpenXR devices not covered by
this specification.

Note that the term "headless" is used here as a term of art referring to
not outputting to a display. It does not refer to the presence or absence
of a head tracker, head-mounted display, or anything else related to
a human head.

When this extension is enabled, the behavior of existing functions that
interact with the graphics subsystem is altered.
When calling the function flink:xrCreateSession with no graphics binding
structure, the session will be created as headless.

When operating with a headless session, the function flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainFormats
must: return an empty list of formats.
Calls to functions flink:xrCreateSwapchain, flink:xrDestroySwapchain,
flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage, flink:xrWaitFrame are invalid.
All other functions, including those related to tracking, input and
haptics, are unaffected.

In addition to this application-facing behavior, the runtime must: not interact
with any display devices on behalf of a headless session.
The runtime should: avoid performing any initialization or resource
acquisition related to graphics or composition.

If the runtime supports transitions between multiple sessions, then
the runtime should: prevent users from transitioning to a headless
session from a regular session and vice versa.
The latter is assumed to be trivial, since the runtime is not allowed to
interact with display devices and therefore prohibited from displaying any
sort of user interface.
If the runtime supports multiple concurrent sessions running at the
same time, it should: allow headless sessions to run concurrently with
regular sessions.

*Overview*

This extension enables the use of the OpenGL ES graphics API in an OpenXR runtime.
Without this extension, the OpenXR runtime may not be able to
use any OpenGL ES swapchain images.

This extension provides the mechanisms necessary for an application to generate a
valid stext:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGLES*KHR structure in order to create a
OpenGL-based slink:XrSession.
Note that during this process the application is responsible for creating all
the required OpenGL ES objects,
including an OpenGL ES context to be used for rendering.

This extension also provides mechanisms for the application to interact with
images acquired by calling flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages.

In order to expose the structures, types, and functions of this extension,
you must: define
dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL_ES, as well as an appropriate
<<window-system-header-control,window system define>> supported by this extension,
before including the OpenXR platform header `openxr_platform.h`,
in all portions of your library or application that include it.
The only window system define currently supported by this extension is:

* dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_ANDROID

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_OPENGL_ES_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_OPENGL_ES_ANDROID_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_OPENGL_ES_KHR

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The following structures are provided to supply supporting runtimes the
necessary information required to work with the OpenGL ES API executing on
certain operating systems.

These structures are only available when the corresponding
`XR_USE_PLATFORM_` macro is defined before including `openxr_platform.h`.

--
The slink:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGLESAndroidKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrGraphicsBindingOpenGLESAndroidKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:display is a valid Android OpenGL ES sname:EGLDisplay.
* pname:config is a valid Android OpenGL ES sname:EGLConfig.
* pname:context is a valid Android OpenGL ES sname:EGLContext.
****

When creating an OpenGL ES-backed slink:XrSession
on Android,
the application will provide
a pointer to an slink:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGLESAndroidKHR in the `next` chain of the
slink:XrSessionCreateInfo.

The required window system configuration define to expose this structure type is
dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_ANDROID.

--
The slink:XrSwapchainImageOpenGLESKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSwapchainImageOpenGLESKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:image is an index indicating the current OpenGL ES swapchain image to use.
****

If a given session was created with a stext:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGLES*KHR,
the following conditions must: apply.

* Calls to flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages on an slink:XrSwapchain in that session
  must: return an array of slink:XrSwapchainImageOpenGLESKHR structures.
* Whenever an OpenXR function accepts an slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader pointer
  as a parameter in that session, the runtime must: also accept a pointer to an
  slink:XrSwapchainImageOpenGLESKHR.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the bottom-left corner of the swapchain image
as the coordinate origin unless specified otherwise by extension functionality.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the swapchain images in a clip space of
positive Y pointing up, near Z plane at -1, and far Z plane at 1.

[open,refpage='XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR',type='structs',desc='OpenGL ES API version requirements',xrefs='xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR']
--
The slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:minApiVersionSupported is the minimum version of OpenGL ES that the runtime supports.
  Uses dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION on major and minor API version, ignoring any patch version component.
* pname:maxApiVersionSupported is the maximum version of OpenGL ES that the runtime
  has been tested on and is known to support.
  Newer OpenGL ES versions might work if they are compatible.
  Uses dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION on major and minor API version, ignoring any patch version component.
****

slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR is populated by flink:xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR with the runtime's
OpenGL ES API version requirements.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR',type='protos',desc='Retrieve the OpenGL ES version requirements for an instance and system',xrefs='XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR']
--
To query OpenGL ES API version requirements for an instance and system, call:

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:systemId is an basetype:XrSystemId handle for the system which will be used to create a session.
* pname:graphicsRequirements is the slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsOpenGLESKHR output structure.
****

The flink:xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR function identifies to the application
the minimum OpenGL ES version requirement and the highest known tested OpenGL ES version.
flink:xrGetOpenGLESGraphicsRequirementsKHR has to be called prior to calling flink:xrCreateSession.

*Overview*

This extension support the providing of a per-view drawing mask for applications. 
The primary purpose of this is to enable performance improvements that result from avoiding drawing on areas that aren't visible to the user.
A common occurrence in head-mounted VR hardware is that the optical system's frustum doesn't intersect precisely with the rectangular display it is viewing.
As a result, it may be that there are parts of the display that aren't visible to the user, such as the corners of the display. 
In such cases it would be unnecessary for the application to draw into those parts.

elink:XrVisibilityMaskTypeKHR identifies the different types of mask specification that is supported.
The application may: request a view mask in any of the formats identified by these types.

.Enumerant Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_VISIBILITY_MASK_TYPE_HIDDEN_TRIANGLE_MESH_KHR refers to a two dimensional triangle mesh on the view surface which may: not be drawn to by the application. 
  slink:XrVisibilityMaskKHR refers to a set of triangles identified by vertices and vertex indices. 
  The index count will thus be a multiple of three.
  The triangle vertices will be returned in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the user perspective.

* ename:XR_VISIBILITY_MASK_TYPE_VISIBLE_TRIANGLE_MESH_KHR refers to a two dimensional triangle mesh on the
  view surface which should: be drawn to by the application. 
  slink:XrVisibilityMaskKHR refers to a set of triangles identified by vertices and vertex indices. 
  The index count will thus be a multiple of three.
  The triangle vertices will be returned in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the user perspective.

* ename:XR_VISIBILITY_MASK_TYPE_LINE_LOOP_KHR refers to a single multi-segmented line loop on the view surface 
  which encompasses the view area which should: be drawn by the application. 
  It is the border that exists between the visible and hidden meshes identified by ename:XR_VISIBILITY_MASK_TYPE_HIDDEN_TRIANGLE_MESH_KHR 
  and ename:XR_VISIBILITY_MASK_TYPE_VISIBLE_TRIANGLE_MESH_KHR.
  The line is counter-clockwise, contiguous, and non-self crossing, with the last point implicitly connecting to the first point.
  There is one vertex per point, the index count will equal the vertex count, and the indices will refer to the vertices.

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrVisibilityMaskKHR',desc='Visibility Mask',type='structs']
--
The slink:XrVisibilityMaskKHR struct is an input/output struct which specifies the view mask.
Upon input to flink:xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR, pname:vertexCount and pname:indexCount refer to the capacity of the vertices and indices members, respectively. 
Upon return from flink:xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR, pname:vertexCount and pname:indexCount refer to the required capacity of the vertices and indices parameters respectively. 

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrVisibilityMaskKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the type of this struct
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:vertexCount is the count of pname:vertices. 
* pname:vertices is an array of vertices that specify coordinates in texture UV space.
* pname:indexCount is the count of pname:indices.
* pname:indices is an array of indices into the pname:vertices array.

[open,refpage='XrEventDataVisibilityMaskChangedKHR',desc='Visibility Mask',type='structs']
--
The slink:XrEventDataVisibilityMaskChangedKHR struct specifies an event which indicates that a given view mask has changed.
The application should: respond to the event by calling flink:xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR to retrieve the updated mask.
This event is per-view, so if the masks for multiple views in a configuration change then multiple instances of this event will be sent to the application, one per view.

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrEventDataVisibilityMaskChangedKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the type of this struct
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the view configuration whose mask has changed.
* pname:viewIndex is the individual view within the view configuration to which the change refers.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR',desc='Gets visibility mask',type='protos']
--
The function flink:xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession handle previously created with flink:xrCreateSession.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the view configuration from which to retrieve mask information.
* pname:viewIndex is the individual view within the view configuration from which to retrieve mask information.
* pname:visibilityMaskType is the type of visibility mask requested.
* pname:visibilityMask is an input/output struct which specifies the view mask.
****

flink:xrGetVisibilityMaskKHR retrieves the view mask for a given view.
If a view mask for the specified view isn't available, the returned vertex and index counts will be zero.
If the input vertex or index count are less than required, ename:XR_ERROR_SIZE_INSUFFICIENT is returned, the vertex and index count will be updated to reflect the required count, and the vertex and index array contents are undefined.

*Overview*

This extension provides two functions for converting between Windows code:QueryPerformanceCounter time and basetype:XrTime.
The flink:xrConvertWin32PerformanceCounterToTimeKHR function converts from Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter time to basetype:XrTime, while the flink:xrConvertTimeToWin32PerformanceCounterKHR function converts basetype:XrTime to Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter time. 
The primary use case for this functionality is to be able to synchronize events between the local system and the OpenXR system.

To convert from Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter time to basetype::XrTime, call:

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrConvertWin32PerformanceCounterToTimeKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:performanceCounter is a time returned by code:QueryPerformanceCounter.
* pname:time is the resulting basetpe::XrTime that is equivalent to the pname:performanceCounter.
****

The flink:xrConvertWin32PerformanceCounterToTimeKHR function converts a time obtained by the Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter function to the equivalent basetype::XrTime.

To convert from basetype::XrTime to Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter time, call:

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrConvertTimeToWin32PerformanceCounterKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:time is an basetype::XrTime.
* pname:performanceCounter is the resulting Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter time that is equivalent to the pname:time.
****

The flink:xrConvertTimeToWin32PerformanceCounterKHR function converts an basetype::XrTime to time as if generated by Win32 code:QueryPerformanceCounter.

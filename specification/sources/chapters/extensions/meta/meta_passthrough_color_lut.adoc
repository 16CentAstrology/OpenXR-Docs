*Overview*

This extension adds the capability to define and apply RGB to RGB(A) color
look-up tables (LUTs) to passthrough layers created using
apiext:XR_FB_passthrough.

Color LUTs are 3-dimensional arrays which map each input color to a
different output color.
When applied to a Passthrough layer, the runtime must: transform Passthrough
camera images according to this map before display.
Color LUTs may: be used to achieve effects such as color grading, level
control, color filtering, or chroma keying.

Color LUTs must: be created using flink:xrCreatePassthroughColorLutMETA
before they can: be applied to a Passthrough layer in a call to
flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB (as a part of
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA or
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA).
A color LUT may: be applied to multiple Passthrough layers simultaneously.

*New Object Types*

[open,refpage='XrPassthroughColorLutMETA',type='handles',desc='Color LUT']

include::{generated}/api/handles/XrPassthroughColorLutMETA.txt[]

slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA represents the definition and data for a
color LUT which may: be applied to a passthrough layer using
flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB.
--

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_SYSTEM_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_PROPERTIES_META
* ename:XR_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_CREATE_INFO_META
* ename:XR_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_UPDATE_INFO_META
* ename:XR_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_MAP_LUT_META
* ename:XR_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_MAP_INTERPOLATED_LUT_META

*New Enums*

The slink:XrSystemPassthroughColorLutPropertiesMETA structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrSystemPassthroughColorLutPropertiesMETA.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:maxColorLutResolution Maximum value for
  slink:XrPassthroughColorLutCreateInfoMETA::pname:resolution supported by
  the system.
  Runtimes implementing this extension must: support a value of at least 32
  for this property.
****

When the apiext:XR_META_passthrough_color_lut extension is enabled, an
application may: pass in an slink:XrSystemPassthroughColorLutPropertiesMETA
structure in next chain structure when calling flink:xrGetSystemProperties
to acquire information about the connected system.

The runtime must: populate the
slink:XrSystemPassthroughColorLutPropertiesMETA structure with the relevant
information to the slink:XrSystemProperties returned by the
flink:xrGetSystemProperties call.

* pname:buffer is a pointer to a memory block of pname:bufferSize bytes that
  contains the LUT data.
****

slink:XrPassthroughColorLutDataMETA defines the LUT data for a color LUT.
This structure is used when creating and updating color LUTs.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:channels defines the color channels expected in one LUT element.
  The number of bytes expected per LUT element is 3 for
  ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_CHANNELS_RGB_META and 4 for
  ename:XR_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_CHANNELS_RGBA_META.
* pname:resolution is the number of LUT elements per input channel.
  The total number of elements in the LUT is [eq]#pname:resolution^3^#.
* pname:data contains the data the LUT is initialized with.
****

pname:resolution must: be a power of 2, otherwise the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.
The runtime may: impose a limit on the maximum supported resolution, which
is indicated in slink:XrSystemPassthroughColorLutPropertiesMETA.
If pname:resolution exceeds that limit, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

pname:data contains a 3-dimensional array which defines an output color for
each RGB input color.
The input color is scaled to be in the range [eq]#[0, pname:resolution]#.
For an RGBA LUT, the RGBA tuple of output colors for an input color
[eq]#(R~in~, G~in~, B~in~)# is found in the four bytes starting at the
offset [eq]#4 * (R~in~ + G~in~ * pname:resolution + B~in~ *
pname:resolution^2^)#.
For an RGB LUT, the RGB tuple of output colors for an input color
[eq]#(R~in~, G~in~, B~in~)# is found in the three bytes starting at the
offset [eq]#3 * (R~in~ + G~in~ * pname:resolution + B~in~ *
pname:resolution^2^)#.

Color LUT data must: be specified and interpreted in sRGB color space.

Runtimes must: employ trilinear interpolation of neighboring color values if
the resolution of the color LUT is smaller than the bit depth of the input
colors.

The value of pname:bufferSize in pname:data must: be equal to
[eq]#pname:resolution^3^ * bytesPerElement#, where [eq]#bytesPerElement# is
either 3 or 4 depending on pname:channels.
Otherwise, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_BUFFER_SIZE_MISMATCH_META.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:data contains the updated LUT data.
****

The LUT data may: be updated for an existing color LUT, while channels and
resolution remain constant after creation.
Hence, the value of pname:bufferSize in pname:data must: be equal to the
buffer size specified at creation.
Otherwise, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_PASSTHROUGH_COLOR_LUT_BUFFER_SIZE_MISMATCH_META.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:colorLut is an slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA.
* pname:weight is a factor in the range [eq]#[0, 1]# which defines the
  linear blend between the original and the mapped colors for the output
  color.
****

slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA lets applications apply a color LUT to a
passthrough layer.
Other Passthrough style elements (such as edges) must: not be affected by
color LUTs.

Applications may: use pname:weight to efficiently blend between the original
colors and the mapped colors.
The blend is computed as [eq]#(1 - pname:weight) * C~in~ + pname:weight *
pname:colorLut[C~in~]#.


slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA is provided in the pname:next chain of
slink:XrPassthroughStyleFB when calling flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB.
Subsequent calls to flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB with
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA in the pname:next chain update the color
LUT for that layer.
Subsequent calls to flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB without this
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA (or
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA) in the next chain disable
color LUTs for that layer.

****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:sourceColorLut is the initial slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA.

* pname:weight is a factor in the range [eq]#[0, 1]# which defines the
  linear blend between the initial and the final color LUT.
****

slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA lets applications apply the
interpolation between two color LUTs to a passthrough layer.
Applications may: use this feature to smoothly transition between two color
LUTs.
Other Passthrough style elements (such as edges) must: not be affected by
color LUTs.

The blend between pname:sourceColorLut and pname:targetColorLut is computed
as [eq]#(1 - pname:weight) * pname:sourceColorLut[C~in~] + pname:weight *
pname:targetColorLut[C~in~]#.

slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA is provided in the pname:next
chain of slink:XrPassthroughStyleFB when calling
flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB.
Subsequent calls to flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB with
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA in the next chain update the
color LUT for that layer.
Subsequent calls to flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB without this
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA (or
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA) in the next chain disable color LUTs for
that layer.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrCreatePassthroughColorLutMETA',desc='Create a passthrough color LUT',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrCreatePassthroughColorLutMETA function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreatePassthroughColorLutMETA.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:passthrough is the slink:XrPassthroughFB this color LUT is created
  for.
* pname:createInfo is the slink:XrPassthroughColorLutCreateInfoMETA.
* pname:colorLut is the resulting slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA.
****

Creates a passthrough color LUT.
The resulting slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA may: be referenced in
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA and
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA in subsequent calls to
flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/xrCreatePassthroughColorLutMETA.txt[]

[open,refpage='xrDestroyPassthroughColorLutMETA',desc='Destroy a passthrough color LUT',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrDestroyPassthroughColorLutMETA function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrDestroyPassthroughColorLutMETA.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:colorLut is the slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA to be destroyed.
****

Destroys a passthrough color LUT.
If the color LUT is still in use (i.e. if for at least one passthrough
layer, flink:xrPassthroughLayerSetStyleFB has last been called with an
instance of slink:XrPassthroughColorMapLutMETA or
slink:XrPassthroughColorMapInterpolatedLutMETA in the next chain that
references this color LUT), the runtime must: retain the color LUT data and
continue applying it to the affected passthrough layer until a different
style is applied.

[open,refpage='xrUpdatePassthroughColorLutMETA',desc='Update a passthrough color LUT',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrUpdatePassthroughColorLutMETA function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrUpdatePassthroughColorLutMETA.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:colorLut is the slink:XrPassthroughColorLutMETA to be updated.
* pname:updateInfo is the slink:XrPassthroughColorLutUpdateInfoMETA.
****

Updates the LUT data of a passthrough color LUT.
The data type of the color LUT (resolution and channels) is immutable.
The provided data in this call must: therefore match the data type specified
at creation time.
Specifically, pname:bufferSize of the new data must: be equal to the
pname:bufferSize specified during creation.
Otherwise, the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The runtime must: reflect changes to color LUT data on all Passthrough
layers the color LUT is currently applied to.

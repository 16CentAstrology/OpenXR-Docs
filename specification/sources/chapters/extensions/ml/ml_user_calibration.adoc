==== Overview

This extension can: be used to determine how well the device is calibrated
for the current user of the device.
The extension provides two events for this purpose:

1. Headset Fit: Provides the quality of the fit of the headset on the user.
2. Eye Calibration: Provides the quality of the user's eye calibration.

==== Enabling user calibration events

User calibration events are requested by calling
flink:xrEnableUserCalibrationEventsML.
When this function is called, each of the user calibration events must: be
posted to the event queue once, regardless of whether there were any changes
to the event data.
This allows the application to synchronize with the current state.

The flink:xrEnableUserCalibrationEventsML function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnableUserCalibrationEventsML.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is a handle to an slink:XrInstance previously created with
  flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:enableInfo is the slink:XrUserCalibrationEnableEventsInfoML that
  enables or disables user calibration events.

The slink:XrUserCalibrationEnableEventsInfoML structure is defined as:

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:enabled is the flag to enable/disable user calibration events.

==== Headset Fit Events

Receiving an slink:XrEventDataHeadsetFitChangedML event from
flink:xrPollEvent notifies the application of headset fit changes.
To enable these events call flink:xrEnableUserCalibrationEventsML and set
slink:XrUserCalibrationEnableEventsInfoML::pname:enabled to true.
Headset fit is evaluated continuously and the runtime must: post events
anytime it detects a change in the headset fit state.

The slink:XrEventDataHeadsetFitChangedML structure is defined as:

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:status is the elink:XrHeadsetFitStatusML headset fit status.
* pname:time is the basetype:XrTime at which the pname:status was captured.

==== Eye Calibration Events

Receiving an slink:XrEventDataEyeCalibrationChangedML event from
flink:xrPollEvent notifies the application of eye calibration changes.
To enable these events call flink:xrEnableUserCalibrationEventsML and set
slink:XrUserCalibrationEnableEventsInfoML::pname:enabled to true.
Runtime must: post events anytime it detects a change in the eye
calibration.
The user needs to calibrate the eyes using the system app provided for this.
There is no support for in-app eye calibration in this extension.

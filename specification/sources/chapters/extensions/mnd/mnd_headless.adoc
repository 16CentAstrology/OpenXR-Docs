*Overview*

Some applications may wish to access XR interaction devices without
presenting any image content on the display(s).
This extension provides a mechanism for writing such an application using
the OpenXR API.
It modifies the specification in the following ways, without adding any new
named entities.


* When this extension is enabled, an application may: call
  flink:xrCreateSession without an stext:XrGraphicsBinding* structure in its
  pname:next chain.
  In this case, the runtime must: create a "headless" session that does not
  interact with the display.
* In a headless session, the session state should: proceed to
  ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_READY directly from ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_IDLE.
* In a headless session, the
  slink:XrSessionBeginInfo::pname:primaryViewConfigurationType must: be
  ignored and may: be `0`.
* In a headless session, the session state proceeds to
  ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_SYNCHRONIZED, then ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_VISIBLE
  and ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_FOCUSED, after the call to
  flink:xrBeginSession.
  The application does not need to call flink:xrWaitFrame,
  flink:xrBeginFrame, or flink:xrEndFrame, unlike with non-headless
  sessions.
* In a headless session, flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainFormats must: return
  ename:XR_SUCCESS but enumerate `0` formats.
* flink:xrWaitFrame must: set slink:XrFrameState::pname:shouldRender to
  ename:XR_FALSE in a headless session.
  The VISIBLE and FOCUSED states are only used for their input-related
  semantics, not their rendering-related semantics, and these functions are
  permitted to allow minimal change between headless and non-headless code
  if desired.

Because flink:xrWaitFrame is not required, an application using a headless
session should: sleep periodically to avoid consuming all available system
resources in a busy-wait loop.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

*New Functions*

*Issues*

* Not all devices with which this would be useful fit into one of the
  existing elink:XrFormFactor values.

*Version History*

* Revision 1, 2019-07-25 (Ryan Pavlik)
** Initial version reflecting Monado prototype.
* Revision 2, 2019-10-22 (Ryan Pavlik)
** Clarify that `xrWaitFrame` is permitted and should set `shouldRender` to
   false.

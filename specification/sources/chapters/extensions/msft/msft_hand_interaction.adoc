*Overview*

This extension defines a new interaction profile for near interactions and
far interactions driven by directly-tracked hands.

*Hand interaction profile*

Interaction profile path:

* pathname:/interaction_profiles/microsoft/hand_interaction

// This extension does not meet the current style guide requirements:
// the path name must be vendor-suffixed in new extensions.
:legacy-path: /interaction_profiles/microsoft/hand_interaction
:properly-suffixed-path: /interaction_profiles/microsoft/hand_interaction_msft
include::{config}/interaction_profile_missing_suffix_warning.adoc[]

Valid for top level user path:

* pathname:/user/hand/left
* pathname:/user/hand/right

This interaction profile provides basic pose and actions for near and far
interactions using hand tracking input.

Supported component paths:

* subpathname:/input/select/value
* subpathname:/input/squeeze/value
* subpathname:/input/aim/pose
* subpathname:/input/grip/pose

ifdef::XR_EXT_palm_pose[]
[NOTE]
.Note
****
When the apiext:XR_EXT_palm_pose extension is available and enabled, this
interaction profile must: also support

* subpathname:/input/palm_ext/pose
****
endif::XR_EXT_palm_pose[]

ifdef::XR_EXT_hand_interaction[]
[NOTE]
.Note
****
When the apiext:XR_EXT_hand_interaction extension is available and enabled,
this interaction profile must: also support

* subpathname:/input/pinch_ext/pose
* subpathname:/input/poke_ext/pose
****
endif::XR_EXT_hand_interaction[]

The application should: use the subpathname:/select/value and
subpathname:/aim/pose paths for far hand interactions, such as using a
virtual laser pointer to target and click a button on the wall.
Here, subpathname:/select/value can: be used as either a boolean or float
action type, where the value `XR_TRUE` or `1.0f` represents a closed hand
shape.

The application should: use the subpathname:/squeeze/value and
subpathname:/grip/pose for near hand interactions, such as picking up a
virtual object within the user's reach from a table.
Here, subpathname:/squeeze/value can: be used as either a boolean or float
action type, where the value `XR_TRUE` or `1.0f` represents a closed hand
shape.

The runtime may: trigger both "select" and "squeeze" actions for the same
hand gesture if the user's hand gesture is able to trigger both near and far
interactions.
The application should: not assume they are as independent as two buttons on
a controller.

*Overview*

This extension enables applications to create slink:XrSpace handles from
other Windows Mixed Reality device platform libraries or APIs.
These libraries represent a spatially tracked point, also known as a
"spatial graph node", with a GUID value.

[open,refpage='xrCreateSpatialGraphNodeSpaceMSFT',desc='Create an slink:XrSpace from a spatial graph node.',type='protos',xrefs='']
--

The flink:xrCreateSpatialGraphNodeSpaceMSFT function creates an
slink:XrSpace handle for a given spatial graph node type and ID.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession which will use the created space.
* pname:createInfo is an slink:XrSpatialGraphNodeSpaceCreateInfoMSFT
  specifying the space to be created.
* pname:space is the returned slink:XrSpace handle for the given spatial
  node ID.

The slink:XrSpatialGraphNodeSpaceCreateInfoMSFT structure is used with
flink:xrCreateSpatialGraphNodeSpaceMSFT to create an slink:XrSpace handle
for a given spatial node type and node ID.

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSpatialGraphNodeSpaceCreateInfoMSFT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:nodeType is an elink:XrSpatialGraphNodeTypeMSFT specifying the
  spatial node type.
* pname:nodeId is a global unique identifier (a.k.a.
  GUID or 16 byte array), representing the spatial node that is being
  tracked.
* pname:pose is an slink:XrPosef defining the position and orientation of
  the new space's origin within the natural reference frame of the spatial
  graph node.

The enum elink:XrSpatialGraphNodeTypeMSFT describes the types of spatial
graph nodes.

include::../../../../generated/api/enums/XrSpatialGraphNodeTypeMSFT.txt[]

There are two types of spatial graph nodes: static and dynamic.

Static spatial nodes track the pose of a fixed location in the world
relative to reference spaces.
The tracking of static nodes may: slowly adjust the pose over time for
better accuracy but the pose is relatively stable in the short term, such as
between rendering frames.
For example, a QR code tracking library can use a static node to represent
the location of the tracked QR code.
Static spatial nodes are represented by
ename:XR_SPATIAL_GRAPH_NODE_TYPE_STATIC_MSFT.

Dynamic spatial nodes track the pose of a physical object that moves
continuously relative to reference spaces.
The pose of dynamic spatial nodes can: be very different within the duration
of a rendering frame.
It is important for the application to use the correct timestamp to query
the space location using flink:xrLocateSpace.
For example, a color camera mounted in front of a HMD is also tracked by the
HMD so a web camera library can use a dynamic node to represent the camera
location.
Dynamic spatial nodes are represented by
ename:XR_SPATIAL_GRAPH_NODE_TYPE_DYNAMIC_MSFT.

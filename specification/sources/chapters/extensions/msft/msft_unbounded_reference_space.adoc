*Overview*

This extension allows an application to create an `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` reference space.
This reference space enables the viewer to move freely through a complex environment,
often many meters from where they started, while always optimizing
for coordinate system stability near the viewer.
This is done by allowing the origin of the reference space to drift as necessary
to keep the viewer's coordinates relative to the space's origin stable.

To create an `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` reference space, the application can:
pass ename:XR_REFERENCE_SPACE_TYPE_UNBOUNDED_MSFT to flink:xrCreateReferenceSpace.

The `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` reference space establishes a world-locked origin,
gravity-aligned to exclude pitch and roll, with +Y up, +X to the right,
and -Z forward.
This space begins with an arbitrary initial position and orientation, which the
runtime may: define to be either the initial position at app launch or
some other initial zero position.
Unlike a `STAGE` reference space, the runtime may: place the origin of an `UNBOUNDED_MSFT`
reference space at any height, rather than fixing it at the floor.
This is because the viewer may move through various rooms and levels of their
environment, each of which has a different floor height.
Runtimes should: not automatically adjust the position of the origin when
the viewer moves to a room with a different floor height.

`UNBOUNDED_MSFT` space is useful when an app needs to render *world-scale* content
that spans beyond the bounds of a single `STAGE`,
for example, an entire floor or multiple floors of a building.

An `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` space maintains stability near the viewer by slightly adjusting
its origin over time.  The runtime must: not queue the
slink:XrEventDataReferenceSpaceChangePending event in response to these
minor adjustments.

When views, controllers or other spaces experience tracking loss relative to
the `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` space, runtimes should: continue to provide inferred or
last-known pname:position and pname:orientation values.
These inferred poses can, for example, be based on neck model updates,
inertial dead reckoning, or a last-known position, so long as it is still
reasonable for the application to use that pose.
While a runtime is providing position data, it must: continue to set
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT and
ename:XR_VIEW_STATE_POSITION_VALID_BIT but it can: clear
ename:XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT and
ename:XR_VIEW_STATE_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT to indicate that the position is
inferred or last-known in this way.

When tracking is recovered, runtimes should: snap the pose of other spaces
back into position relative to the `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` space's original origin.
However, if tracking recovers into a new tracking volume in which the
original origin can no longer be located (e.g. the viewer moved through
a dark hallway and regained tracking in a new room), the runtime may: recenter
the origin arbitrarily, for example moving the origin to coincide with the viewer.
If such recentering occurs, the runtime must: queue the
slink:XrEventDataReferenceSpaceChangePending event with pname:poseValid set to false.

If the viewer moves far enough away from the origin of an `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` reference space
that floating point error would introduce noticeable error when locating the viewer
within that space, the runtime may: recenter the space's origin to a new location
closer to the viewer.  If such recentering occurs, the runtime must: queue the
slink:XrEventDataReferenceSpaceChangePending event with pname:poseValid set to true.

Runtimes must: support the `UNBOUNDED_MSFT` reference space when this extension is enabled.

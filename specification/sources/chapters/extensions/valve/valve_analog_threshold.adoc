*Overview*

This extension allows the application to control the threshold and haptic
feedback applied to an analog to digital conversion.
See slink:XrInteractionProfileAnalogThresholdVALVE for more information.

Applications should: also enable the `<<XR_KHR_binding_modification>>`
extension to be able to define multiple thresholds.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrInteractionProfileAnalogThresholdVALVE structure is an input
struct that defines thresholds and haptic feedback behavior for action
bindings and should: be added to the pname:bindingModifications array of the
slink:XrBindingModificationsKHR structure (See
`<<XR_KHR_binding_modification>>` extension).

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:action is the handle of an action in the suggested binding list.
* pname:binding is the input path used for the specified action in the
  suggested binding list.
* pname:onThreshold is the value between 0.0 and 1.0 at which the runtime
  must: consider the binding to be true.
  The binding must remain true until the input analog value falls below
  pname:offThreshold.
* pname:offThreshold is the value between 0.0 and 1.0 at which the runtime
  must: consider the binding to be false if it was previous true.
* pname:onHaptic is the haptic output that the runtime must: trigger when
  the binding changes from false to true.
  If this field is NULL, the runtime must: not trigger any haptic output on
  the threshold.
  This field can: point to any supported sub-type of
  slink:XrHapticBaseHeader.
* pname:offHaptic is the haptic output that the runtime must: trigger when
  the binding changes from true to false.
  If this field is NULL, the runtime must: not trigger any haptic output on
  the threshold.
  This field can: point to any supported sub-type of
  slink:XrHapticBaseHeader.
****

Applications can also chain a single
slink:XrInteractionProfileAnalogThresholdVALVE structure on the next chain
of any flink:xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings call.
Runtimes must: support this kind of chaining.
This method of specifying analog thresholds is deprecated however, and
should not be used by any new applications.

If a threshold struct is present for a given conversion, the runtime must:
use those thresholds instead of applying its own whenever it is using the
binding suggested by the application.

pname:onThreshold and pname:offThreshold permit allow the application to
specify that it wants hysteresis to be applied to the threshold operation.
If pname:onThreshold is smaller than pname:offThreshold, the runtime must:
return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

pname:onHaptic and pname:offHaptic allow the application to specify that it
wants automatic haptic feedback to be generated when the boolean output of
the threshold operation changes from false to true or vice versa.
If these fields are not NULL, the runtime must: trigger a haptic output with
the specified characteristics.
If the device has multiple haptic outputs, the runtime should: use the
haptic output that is most appropriate for the specified input path.

If a suggested binding with pname:action and pname:binding is not in the
binding list for this interaction profile, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_PATH_UNSUPPORTED.

*Version History*

* Revision 1, 2020-06-29 (Joe Ludwig)
** Initial version.
* Revision 2, 2021-07-28 (Rune Berg)
** Deprecate chaining of struct in
   slink:XrInteractionProfileSuggestedBinding, applications should use
   slink:XrBindingModificationsKHR defined in the
   `<<XR_KHR_binding_modification>>` extension instead.

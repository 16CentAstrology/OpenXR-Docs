*Overview*

This extension provides a mechanism for enabling depth estimation of the
environment in the runtime-supplied compositor.
This is an extension to ename:XR_ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND mode to
not only use the color but also depth for composition of the final image.

Mixed reality applications might want to mix real and virtual content based
on the depth information for proper occlusion.
XR hardware and runtime may offer various ways to estimate the depth of the
environment inside the compositor.
When this estimation is enabled, the compositor can generate properly
occluded final image when layers are submitted with depth information (both
apiext:XR_KHR_composition_layer_depth and
apiext:XR_VARJO_composition_layer_depth_test).

This extension defines a new function,
flink:xrSetEnvironmentDepthEstimationVARJO, which can: be used to toggle
environment depth estimation in the compositor.
Toggling depth estimation is an asynchronous operation and the feature may:
not be activated immediately.
Function can be called immediately after the session is created.
Composition of the environment layer follows the rules as described in
apiext:XR_VARJO_composition_layer_depth_test.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession handle previously created with
  flink:xrCreateSession.
* pname:enabled is a boolean that specifies whether depth estimation
  functionality should be activated.
  Compositor will disable depth estimation functionality if environment
  blend mode is not ename:XR_ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND and will
  enable the functionality when environment blend mode is set to
  ename:XR_ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND.

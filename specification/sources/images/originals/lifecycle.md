The diagram `lifecycle.drawio` is created/edited with <https://draw.io>.

For inclusion in the specification, when revised, it is manually exported from draw.io as PDF,
then imported into Inkscape and exported as an SVG. Otherwise, compatibility issues are seen
with the SVG as directly saved from draw.io.
